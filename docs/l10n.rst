Localisation (L10n)
===================
There are several ways to add localisation to a web site. For small projects
arrays with string can work but this is not very efficient and user-friendly.
With `Gettext`_ is a toolset available that provide a framework to produce
multi-lingual content in a wide area of programming languages.

.. _Gettext: http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/
.. _php-gettext: http://php.net/gettext

Make sure that the `php-gettext`_ package is available on your system. If not
install it.::

    $ sudo yum -y install php-php-gettext

Check if gettext support is available.::

    <?php
        if (!function_exists("gettext")){
            echo "gettext is not installed\n";
        }
        else{
            echo "gettext is supported\n";
        }
    ?>

Make sure that all locales your want are available on the server::

    locale -a

The first step is to mark all string which should be translatable as shown
below. For further details please refer to the `Gettext`_ documentation.::

    echo _('Some text');

The next step is to extract all strings. ::

    xgettext --from-code=UTF-8 -o locale/webshop.pot *.php

For every language a po file is needed for the transations. Generate it with
the command mentioned below::

    msginit --no-translator -l de_CH -o locale/de_CH.po -i locale/webshop.pot

Create the mo file for the specific language

    msgfmt -c -v -o locale/de_CH/LC_MESSAGES/webshop.mo locale/de_CH.po
